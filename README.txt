Introduction

The Illumina genotyping microarray LIMS exports raw and processed data
together in a compact binary format called a Genotype Call (GTC) file.

This package contains some basic utility functions for parsing GTC
files. It is exploratory code written to assess various options for
managing the data downstream.
